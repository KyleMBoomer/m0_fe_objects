# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
1. It felt great to have confidence in answering questions and solving the problems presented. I'm hoping to build on that. 

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
1. I am trying to stay consistent with a 50/10 pomodoro split for work/breaks. Sometimes that can be challenging, when I feel I am close to a solution and the break alarm sounds. But discipline is going to be integral to success, I think, so I must abide!

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
1. The concept of layering is woven into the JavaScript processes. It seems whatever concept we've laarned, it can be a part of a previous one. Trying to keep those layers straight is my goal.
